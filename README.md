# ScreenshotSaverService
A prototype of a back-end service for inputting as list of URLs and receiving screenshots.

Requirements:
* The service should store the result of the request.
* The user would then be able to query the service for the results, the user should be able to
retrieve the results at any point in time.
* Message queues could be used to separate the different parts of the service and prepare
for scalability.
